					<p>Born in 1964 in Osaka, Japan, the filmmaker Yang Yonghi comes from a Korean family supporting the communist
						regime in
						North Korea. In 1971, her father sent her three elder brothers to Pyongyang to help building up the
						socialist nation.
						They have not been allowed to leave the country ever since. As only daughter, Yang Yonghi stayed with her
						parents in
						Japan and received a North Korean education until she left for film studies in New York. After her return
						she made
						two documentaries,
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span> (2005) and
						<span class="filmtitel">SONA, THE OTHER MYSELF</span> (2009). She also wrote several books about her family
						history. In 2011, she realized
						her first fiction film
						<span class="filmtitel">OUR HOMELAND</span> which has been selected as Japanese entry for the Academy
						Awards.</p>
					<p>Yang Yonghi's films in a touching personal way describe the influence of the Korean division &mdash;a
						result of the
						Cold War&mdash; on today's individuals and their family spread all over the world.</p>
					<p>The retrospective at
						<em>Werkstattkino</em> shows all her films in the original version with English or German subtitles. From
						January 12
						<sup>th</sup> to 15
						<sup>th</sup>, the director will be at the screenings in Munich for Q&A.</p>

								<p class="filmtext">In her first feature documentary, the Japanese born ethnic Korea Yang Yonghi
									explores her father's fierce loyality,
									and her own resistance, to the North Korean cause. As a teenager, the filmmaker's father emigrated
									from the South
									Korean island Cheju to Japan. His experiences of Japanese occupation, Korea's subsequent division, and
									the Korean
									War molded him into a self-pro-claimed North Korean and supporter of Kim Il-Sung. In 1971, in the
									ultimate ideological
									sacrifice, he sent his three sons – ages 14, 16, and 18 – to Pyongyang, North Korea, forever. Thirty
									years later,
									Yang Yong-hi, his youngest child, raised with the privileges of modern Japan, lovingly probes her
									father about his
									radical choices.</p>

						<a name="Interview">Interview with Yang Yonghi</a>
					</h2>

			<div class="row interview">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p class="question">Can you tell me about the process of making
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span>?</p>
					<p class="answer">Some filmmakers work very quickly, but I can't do that. I spent ten years to make
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span> Making this film was a process of gazing at my family. I
						realized what a trauma it was for me
						to lose my brothers. I had been trying not to touch that memory too often, but when I started to talk with
						my father,
						memories came back.
						<br> Before the film, we had a very bad communication, especially with my father. But after I had decided to
						make this
						documentary, I tried to get closer to him, which he avoided in the beginning. He was really suspicious! But
						at the
						same time it made him happy. And so we started to talk.
						<br> During shooting and editing, I tried to be honest but careful at the same time. And when I started
						editing, my father
						had a stroke. His condition was fragile, and I went back and forth between the hospital in Osaka and the
						editing room
						in Tokyo. There, I saw my father singing and joking, but at the hospital … Well, he didn't die at that time,
						but I
						kept thinking I might lose him. During the eight months of editing I cried a lot and I drank a lot, too
						<em>(laughing)</em>.</p>

					<p class="question">After
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span> you were not allowed to enter North Korea anymore…</p>
					<p class="answer">When I went to North Korea for the first time with a video camera, the check person at the
						seaport didn't know anything
						about video cameras. They thought it was a big still camera. But later they asked me why I brought so many
						empty video
						tapes with me, and I tried to explain that this was my diary. But they didn't accept that as an answer and I
						was always
						taken to an extra room. They checked all my luggage. Sometimes, the huge ferry boat with all people had to
						wait for
						me. They also checked all my footage, but at that time they didn't know that we can make documentaries in
						many different
						ways. After I releasedh
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span>, they finally found out that checking video tapes doesn't mean
						anything. Of course, many people
						make documentaries with the permission of the North Korean government, but I am not interested in that.</p>

					<p class="question">During the last years there has been a wave of documentaries shot in North Korea by
						Western directors under the permission
						of the North Korean government. What makes your films unique is this special approach through your familye…
					</p>
					<p class="answer">…and that I never tried to make a film about North Korea! I am actually not interested in
						North Korea or in political
						issues at all! I don't care about the Kim family, my documentaries are about my family. It's an interesting
						family
						with very good characters: my father, Sona, my niece… Nice and simple people, very talkative… good
						characters for a
						documentary! But, in order to talk about my family history, I have to touch North Korea and the history of
						<em>Zainichi</em> (second generation Koreans) in Japan.</p>

					<p class="question">Let's come to
						<span class="filmtitel">SONA, THE OTHER MYSELF</span>. The circumstances seem very different. You had
						financial support from South Korea and
						basically a South Korean team.</p>
					<p class="answer">Only the post production team was from South Korea. Shooting is always my private work.
						After
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span> I was kind of broke, although I had received several great
						awards. I didn't want to work for
						TV production companies anymore, but I knew that I wanted to do another clip with Sona. Then a small
						production company
						in South Korea called and invited me to Seoul, and we started editing
						<span class="filmtitel">SONA</span>.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">

					<p class="question">One difference between
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span> and
						<span class="filmtitel">SONA</span> is that you are very often on screen and there is someone else filming
						you. Why did you decide to appear
						in the film?</p>
					<p class="answer">Actually I didn't want to do that. The footage I used for both documentaries,
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span> and
						<span class="filmtitel">SONA</span> was shot over a long time, and my presence in the picture is very
						constant. Especially in the beginning,
						from 1995 to 1997, when I was not so sure if I was going to make a documentary, I pretended to be a visitor,
						not a
						filmmaker or journalist. The travels to North Korea are always official trips and you are surrounded by many
						people.
						So it was very difficult to move as a cameraman and sometimes I gave the camera to anyone and asked them to
						take pictures
						of us, my niece and me together. It was not like professional filmmaking, more like taking souvenir
						pictures.
						<br> The editor for
						<span class="filmtitel">SONA, THE OTHER MYSELF</span> was a Korean documentary filmmaker (Jang Jin). He is a
						nice family man, and he couldn't
						stop crying: O my god, you can't see Sona anymore… He liked the pictures of Sona and me together and
						strongly insisted
						to use them, and although I hated that, I agreed in the end.
						<br> Editing
						<span class="filmtitel">SONA</span> I felt I was ready to be more honest, or more direct than with
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span>. It was hard because my mother asked me not to talk about my
						brother's illness, although this
						was important to me. Being honest needs a lot of energy.</p>

					<p class="question">
						<span class="filmtitel">DEAR PYONGYANG</span> is about your father, and
						<span class="filmtitel">SONA</span> is basically about your niece, but
						<span class="filmtitel">OUR HOMELAND</span> is actually about you. Why did you choose the fictional form for
						this topic? </p>
					<p class="answer">During the shooting, I realized that sometimes fiction can be more real than documentary.
						Because in a documentary,
						I cannot shoot certain conversations or face expressions. I had a real dream cast, especially the young
						actors, Ando
						Sakura and Iura Arata. When I watched Ando Sakura act, I realized I must have had her face expression when I
						said good-bye
						to my brother. I didn't know that before and it was an interesting experience.The shooting process opened my
						memory
						box, and I was overwhelmed. So I cried a lot, not during shooting, but afterwards, in the bathroom or at
						home.
						<br> One day, the actor Iura Arata came to me when I was crying. He thought I might be crying out of fear
						because I was
						a newcomer or because I was too nervous. He asked if I was OK and I said: I am totally OK, but because of
						you guys
						acting, my memories came back, and I just can't stop crying. And he said: That's OK, please cry. </p>

					<p class="question">What's your next project?</p>
					<p class="answer">I am now writing my first novel. It will be finished in December. And from next year, I will
						be busy with shooting a
						documentary about my mum and also writing a new script. It's a love story between a Japanese man and a
						Korean women,
						who is a little bit complicated. Not simply Zainichi, but – you will see!</p>
